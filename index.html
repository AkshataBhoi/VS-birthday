                <h2>Our Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    It all began in <b><u><i>our 3rd semester</i></u></b> — the first spark in a world we never knew we were creating. I joined as a direct second-year diploma student, and there <b><i>he was — our CR — organised, responsible,</i> and probably unaware that someone was already noticing how effortlessly he handled everything........</b><br><br>
                </p>

                <span class="mybox2" id="mybox1id1" style="text-align:justify ;">
                    Our first real conversation? 24th September 2024, during our first unit test. Nervous? Yes. Awkward? Maybe. But we talked about everything—past colleges, where we lived, assignments, practicals—and just like that, something quietly clicked.<br><br>
                    <b><i>Oh, and I remember this so clearly: I once called him in college, and he was so adorably confused about who it was, but still replied with the sweetest politeness. That was the first time I heard his voice—deep, calm, and unexpectedly comforting. Something about it just stayed with me.</i></b><br><br>
                    We slowly became good friends, our calls and chats getting longer.<br><br> 
                    <strong><i>Putting these memories into words feels unfair—because they’re so much more than words.</i></strong><br><br>
                    We focused on exams too, even when he told me he'd be away from 25th October to 25th December. That time? It hurt. The reason… he knows. But we found our way back—talking again about exams, skills, and life.<br><br>
                    <b><i>And just before New Year, he sent me a video—something about staying positive and taking care of mental health.</i></b> I watched it, and for a while, I really lived by it. But emotions don’t always play by the rules, and I slipped back into sadness.<br><br>
                    Still, he changed that. <br>(…to be continued 💙)

                        It was just an ordinary day—12th January—but I didn’t know it would change my entire world.

                        We were talking, like we always did, about portfolios and college things. That’s when he said something that made my heart pause for a second:

                        <b><i>“You’re my best friend... the only girl I truly talk to.”</i></b>

                        He said it so simply, but to me—<b>it was everything. It was trust, it was connection, it was comfort......</b>
                </p>
                <span id="span1"> </span>


                <span class="mybox1" id="mybox1id" style="display: none;">
        
                    I opened up a little about my past—just enough to let him see the cracks, not the pain.<br><br>
                    But that night, he had a dream. A dream that would change everything.

                    The next evening, he messaged me: <strong><i>“Urgent. Need to talk.”</i></strong> I was just about to board my train home, standing at Thane station, but I didn’t move. Something told me this moment was different. I stood there, waiting... for half an hour. Not because I had to—but because I wanted to.

                    He came online. Nervous, fidgeting, trying to find the words. And then, he told me about the dream.

                    In the dream, he asked me to be his... and I didn’t answer.

                    So now—he was asking in real life. Half-joking. Half-serious. Completely vulnerable.

                    “Will you accept me as your boyfriend?”

                    My mind froze. My heart raced. I was shocked, speechless, but not because I didn’t know what to say.

                    I knew. I always knew.I had feelings for him long before I admitted it to myself. I had already told my heart once: “He’s not mine... and never will be.” But destiny had other plans.

                    I said<br>  <center><strong><i>"yes,I can accept u as my boyfriend........"</i></strong></center>  He hadn’t expected it. For relationaship, he asked for time. And I said okay…

                    But inside me, something broke. What if this moment faded away? What if I was only ever “just a friend” again?

                    And yet, even in the ache—I was ready. Even if I had to love him quietly, I would.<br>

                    But then…On the night of 14th January, his message lit up my world:<br>

                    <center><strong><i>“I, Vivek, accept you as my girlfriend.”</i></strong></center>

                    I stared at those words with tears in my eyes and the biggest smile on my face.

                    <b>Because this wasn’t a fairytale—it was our story.</b><br>

                    I saw him in college after that, and oh, <b><i>that smile... brighter than the sun, warmer than any hug.</i></b><br><br>

                    <b><i><u></u>Yes, in the beginning, his feelings were still growing. But Real Love doesn’t always start with fire. Sometimes, it starts with warmth. And it builds.</u></i></b><br>  

                    He told me later that he chose to love me. That those feelings bloomed slowly and fully. And when he said that, my heart—once scared—just whispered:

                    <b><i>“He’s not like the rest. He’s yours. Truly, deeply yours.”</i></b> And so, our story unfolded… <br><br>

                    🌸 Our <b>first date—both our firsts</b>. He brought me a tiny, thoughtful greeting and a keychain (which still lives with me). I gave him a ring—and now we both wear them, a silent promise around our fingers.

                    💫 <b>Then came the second... third... fourth... and fifth dates. And with each one, laughter became louder, moments got sweeter, and love grew stronger.</b> <strong><i>Dates turned into memories. Laughter, kisses, silly moments</i></strong><br>
                    💋<b><i>Our first kiss? Haha—it happened in an auto, of all places. Clumsy, shy, and unforgettable.

                    And then… one day, in the classroom—he kissed me again. Soft. Pure. Loving. I felt seen. Cherished. Loved.</i></b><br><br>

                    One day, I wore a saree—just because <b>he wished to see me in one.</b> <strong><i>And the way he looked at me… seating shirtless, smiling, those eyes full of wonder—I knew I was loved, deeply.

                    I felt like the most beautiful girl in the world.</i></strong><br><br>
                    He’s changed so much for me.From cold and hard person to loving and soft. He grew with me. Loved me more than I thought possible. And I? I love him endlessly.

                    My love, my strength, my reason to smile every day.

                    He is everything good: mature, kind, funny, intelligent, and so full of love.<br>

                    <center><strong><i>And best of all—he's mine.</i></strong><br><br>

                    <strong style="font-size: 25px;"><b><i>Forever. 💖</i></b></strong></center>
